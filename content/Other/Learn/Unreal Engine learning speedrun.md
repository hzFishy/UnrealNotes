This speedrun is aimed to learn the basics of Unreal Engine with some blueprint & visual scripting basics. <br>
This page has a lot of content, you can easily navigate between categories using the Table of Contents on the right.

> [!Info]  About C++
> If you want to learn more about how to work with C++ in UE, I would recommend checking [Laura's C++ speedrun blog post](https://landelare.github.io/2023/01/07/cpp-speedrun.html).
# Access & getting started
Download Unreal Engine from the Epic Games launcher:
- Click on "Unreal Engine" on the left side bar
- On the top bar click on "Library"
- Add the UE version you want
- If needed, download extra content for your UE version by clicking on "Options" (after clicking on the small down arrow next to "Launch/Update/Install/Resume")

Once you launched a engine version you will be able to load a existing project or create a new one using a template.

> [!tip]
> You can directly open a existing UE project with the correct engine version from the "My Projects" area

Other UE stuff such as your assets from your Fab library are accessible below the engine version, if some are missing try to refresh using the refresh button

# Interface anatomy
Here are the main components of the UE interface: 
## Global

# Engine anatomy & basics

## Introduction

### Conventions
Unreal Engine location, rotation and scale units are in centimeters. <br>
In UE, the forward axis is X and the up axis is Z.

### Coding
When you code in UE, you have two layers: the C++ layer and the Blueprint layer. <br>
C++ can be mandatory to use special features or tools. C++ is also a lot faster than Blueprint code, which can make it a very important choice depending on what logic you want to execute in your game.

The Blueprint layer is built on top of the C++ layer, either on already existing engine classes or on yours that you made in C++, which means you don't **need** to do anything in C++ and work on your game with only the Blueprint layer (not recommended for big or multiplayer projects).

A Blueprint is an asset that inherits from a class, for example `Actor` (`AActor` being the real C++ name). In a blueprint you can already see/edit what is exposed from C++ (for example variables or components).

### Actor Blueprint hierarchy
Unlike other engines like Unity, you don't create a empty "Game Object" then add components. <br>In UE you create a new blueprint asset, and this blueprint can already hold logic.

> [!Warning]
> You can only create new blueprints from the content browser or using the Quick Add tool.
> This means that you can't make a unique blueprint classes/instances directly in a level, it must exist in the Content Browser.

You can extend any Actor class it with `Actor Components` or `Scene Components`.
- A `Actor Component` don't have any transform, it's just a block of whatever logic attached to your actor.
- A `Scene Component` is the same as an `Actor Component` but it has a transform and must be attached somewhere on your Actor (at the root of the actor or on any other `Scene Component`), it also support sockets.

> [!Info]
> More about Actors in [[#Main classes]]
## Structure
> Check the graph or watch the video about the basics of engine structure [here](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/98E/unreal-engine-begin-play-engine-structure?source=0w)

## Main classes

> [!error] For new programmers
> If you are new to programming or if you don't know what a `class`, `child` or `parent` is please read [[Classes and inheritance]] before going any further !

> [!example] Actor
> "Actor is the base class for an Object that can be placed or spawned in a level. Actors may contain a collection of Actor Components, which can be used to control how actors move, how they are rendered, etc." - [UE Docs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Runtime/Engine/GameFramework/AActor)
> > [!info] About persistence
> > Most actors (and objects) doesn't persist between levels (which usually means losing data).
> > There is a custom solution to make any actor transferred to the new target level, but the easiest way is to store the persistent data on classes that are already persistent (see persistent classes below).

> [!example] Pawn
> "Pawn is the base class of all actors that can be possessed by players or AI. They are the physical representations of players and creatures in a level." - [UE Docs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Runtime/Engine/GameFramework/APawn)

> [!example] Character
>"Characters are Pawns that have a mesh, collision, and built-in movement logic. They are responsible for all physical interaction between the player or AI and the world, and also implement basic networking and input models." - [UE Docs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Runtime/Engine/GameFramework/ACharacter)

> [!example] Player Controller
> "Player Controllers are used by human players to control Pawns." - [UE Docs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Runtime/Engine/GameFramework/APlayerController)

> [!example] Player State
> "A Player State is created for every player. Player States should contain game relevant information about the player, such as score, etc." - [UE Docs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Runtime/Engine/GameFramework/APlayerState)
>  > [!tip] *Persists between levels*

> [!example] Game Mode
> "Defines the game being played. It governs the game rules, scoring, what actors are allowed to exist in this game type, and who may enter the game." - [UE Docs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Runtime/Engine/GameFramework/AGameModeBase)
> > [!tip] *Persists between levels*

> [!example] Game State
> "Is a class that manages the game's global state, and is spawned by the Game Mode." -  [UE Docs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Runtime/Engine/GameFramework/AGameStateBase)

> [!example] Game Instance
> "A high-level manager object for an instance of the running game. Spawned at game creation and not destroyed until game instance is shut down." - [UE Docs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Runtime/Engine/Engine/UGameInstance)
>  > [!tip] *Persists between levels*

> [!example] HUD
> "Base class of the heads-up display. This has a canvas and a debug canvas on which primitives can be drawn." - [UE Docs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Runtime/Engine/GameFramework/AHUD)
> The HUD class can be used as a isolated area to manage to create, show, hide and destroy UserWidgets.

> [!example] User Widget
> "UserWidgets are used in Epic Games' UI System, called **Unreal Motion Graphics** (UMG)." - [Cedric](https://cedric-neukirchen.net/docs/multiplayer-compendium/common-classes/userwidget/)
> This is the class you will use to display text, menus, inputs and more.

> The `soft` version is special, a soft reference (or pointer) is a type that contains a path to an asset (which can be none), and it contains a pointer to an instance of that asset (which can be null). <br>
> It is **very** important and common to use soft object/class references to load asynchronously assets (for example some sounds that doesn't need to be loaded at the beginning of the game).
> <br>It's also very useful if you want to get a reference to an actor placed in a level (this would use the actor absolute path in the level).
> - `Soft Object Reference`: A soft reference to an instance of a object.
> - `Soft Class Reference`: A soft reference to a class of a object.

> [!Info] Enum type

> I found a great comment on how to visualize a enum:
> > [!quote] A Reddit User
> > Think of an enum like a drop-down list, rather than just a blank text box you can type into. Using an enum ensures that only values you've predefined as part of that enum can be present in a particular field/variable, rather than using a raw string which could contain anything.

> [!Info] Containers (`Single`, `Array`, `Set` or `Map`)
> For almost every variables types, you can decide if your variable *container* type is `Single`, `Array`, `Set` or `Map`. <br>
> ![[Pasted image 20241109190356.png|200]] <br>
> By default it's `Single`, as the name implies, it contains only one value.

> 
> **Set** <br> A set is very similar to the array, but ...
> - ... a set cannot contain the same value twice.
> - ... there is no order in a set, it's like if you add a marble to a bag of marbles, you know what you added but you don't know how they got mixed up. So if you convert your set to an array, and try to get the value at index 0, you probably won't get the first element you previously added.
> 
> **Map**<br> A map is like a dictionary in other languages. A map contains a list of pair of keys and an associated value. To obtain a value you must therefore give the correct key, there is no order in a map.

### Events, Functions & Macros

Sometimes you need a piece of code in multiple places. Instead of duplicating it, the best is to transform it into a event, function or macro. But what is the difference ?.

Mainly:
- Events are used for thing that don't return anything and that can execute in parallel.
- Functions are used if you need output values.
- Macros are used if you need to use *time* nodes or if you want multiple exec output pins. 

| Type     | <div style="width:80px">Exec inputs</div> | <div style="width:100px">Type inputs</div> | <div style="width:100px">Exec outputs</div> | <div style="width:100px">Type outputs</div> | <div style="width:150px">Access</div>  | <div style="width:250px">Other</div>                                                                          |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Event    | One                                       | One or multiple                            | None                                        | None                                        | Can be called from anywhere if public. | The execution flow does not wait for the "end" of the event, it calls the event then continues in parallel    |
| Function | One                                       | One or multiple                            | One                                         | One or multiple                             | Can be called from anywhere if public. | Cannot contain any *time* nodes *(Delay, Cooldown, ...)*. <br> Can be overridden in parent classes if public. |
| Macro    | Multiple                                  | One or multiple                            | One or multiple                             | One or multiple                             | Can only be called inside the class.   |                                                                                                               |

> [!tip] Overriding
> You can override a function in a parent class if the function is public and exposed.
> For example, the `Actor` has those function overridable by default: <br>
> ![[Pasted image 20241109193658.png|200]]
> 
> You can get events from exposed function by clicking on a actor or scene component and scrolling down in the details panel

> <br>Here i selected my Box component and clicked on the `+` next to `On Component Begin Overlap`
> ![[Pasted image 20241109201057.png|600]]


> [!tip] Collapsing
> You can collapse code into a graph, function or macro to gain time. <br> ![[Pasted image 20241109193436.png|450]]

### Context Menu

The context menu is what is shown when your right click in a BP graph.

**Filter** <br>
Depending on where you right click (and what you were dragging), the options are different, because UE filters out any actions for you that are "unrelated/don't make sense".
> [!tip] Toggle the filter
> You can deactivate/reactivate this filter at the top right.
> 
> ![[Pasted image 20241108221533.png|250]]


**Keywords** <br>
UE saves you time, you don't need to type the full name of each node to get it. Just type in keywords.
> [!info] Example with basic math operations
> If you want to do a mathematical operation, you can type the symbol directly.
> 
> ![[Pasted image 20241108223556.png|250]]
> 
> This works with Add (`+`), Substract (`-`), Multiply (`*`), Divide (`/`) and more !

Some keywords are premade (mostly for engine nodes), but you can add yours in the `Keywords` entry.

>![[Pasted image 20241108223951.png]]


### Organizing nodes

There is different ways to keep your code organized. <br>
The most known one is **comments** ! In UE you can comment individual nodes, or comment inside a group.

**Individual node comment** <br>
Hover your node then click on the little bubble to show it (and do the same if you want to hide it).

![[Pasted image 20241108225005.png|300]]

![[Pasted image 20241108224851.png|300]]

> [!tip]
> You can make a comment always displayed in a graph by pinning it, even when zoomed out.
> 
> ![[Pasted image 20241108225115.png]]
> ![[Pasted image 20241108225121.png]]

**Group comment** <br>
You can make a group by pressing the group key (`C` key by default), if you want to make a group around already placed nodes, drag an area with your mouse then press the group key.

**Reroute nodes** <br>
Sometimes you will have lines that will overlap each other or with nodes. With a double click on the line you can create a `Reroute Node`. <br>
This is possible with execution and variables *lines*. Once created you can move reroute nodes wherever you want.

# Training exercises
So now that you read all of that, you need some practice to be sure your understood everything AND to learn even more !

If you already have some projects ideas and the listed exercises seems to boring for you, don't hesitate to directly start to learn by doing your project. <br>**But be careful !** Don't overkill yourself with a very big game that will probably make you hate UE (because what you have to learn will be to big for a new UE user). <br>Start with something "small" or "medium", something that you like and can be scaled up when you will have more knowledge and motivation to make a great game !
