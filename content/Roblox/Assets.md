## General
[Assets docs](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/projects/assets)
Each asset has its unique ID.
By default they are private to your experience, but you can decide to make them accessible to anyone by making them public.


## Packages
[Packages docs](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/projects/assets/packages)
You can decide to update or not instances of a package.
For update details see [here](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/projects/assets/packages#automatic-updates). **A MODIFIED PACKAGE INSTANCE/COPY WONT BE UPDATED**


## Places
A [Place](https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/projects#places) is in simple terms a map/level. Each place contains all components for that portion of the experience, including its specific environment, parts, meshes, scripts, and user interface.
Every place is represented by a data model.
