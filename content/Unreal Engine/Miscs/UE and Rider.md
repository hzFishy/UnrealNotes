# Templates
When you create a new UE class with Rider, it shows up templates.
Some of those templates are defined by the engine by default, the others are generated by Rider *(I think, and I don't know where, probably just a runtime generation where it looks what the parents are)*.

You can edit them, for the templates defined by default by UE the template files are at `\YourEngineRoorFolder\Engine\Content\Editor\Templates`.
