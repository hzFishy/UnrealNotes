# Introduction
As the the name says, GPT AIs are "Generative pre-trained transformer"s.

Models like ChatGPT generates an output **by treating words as number sequences that it then compares to other number sequences within a similar context**.
This means that they **don't** understand words, your prompt and the answer is only an analysis of your words in a huge database and a bunch of algorithms working to find the most suitable word or sequence of words. This is one of the reasons why it can hallucinate an answer, and if you tell him that he is wrong he will say "oh, you are right!" and find another one.

Also, as you probably know, ChatGPT is trained on the internet (and depending on the version its based until 2021 or until now).
This means that when you get an answer from ChatGPT, it can be a copy paste of a message that someone wrote or a mix of multiple human written text merged together. This behavior demonstrates well the *generative* process of ChatGPT, **it doesn't think of an answer**, it finds it on the internet, or can something hallucinate some words.

# GPT models & Unreal Engine
*Almost the same could be told for Unity or any other engine/tool*

Regarding UE, ChatGPT isn't recommended, but if you really want to use it for starters, it isn't recommended to use it once you know the basics of UE.

**Why ?**
Well any human can read the source code of UE, where there is everything you need, but AI models can't be trained on it because the source code is "private" (you need to create an Epic and GitHub account, link them and agree to the Unreal Engine EULA).
This means that ChatGPT trained itself on publicly available sources, which are only the Official Docs, forums such as the official one and Reddit, blogs, and maybe YouTube video transcripts.
It can sometimes have some source code snippets that users copied from the source, but that's it.

The biggest issue is that forums posts holds the vast majority of data, and the most used forums publicly available are the official one and Reddit. This would mean that a big % of the answers ChatGPT gives you when asking a UE question comes from posts and comments user wrote on those forums.
And this leads to an issue, forums posts are written by a lot of different kind of people, people asking, people answering right and people saying bad stuff. And ChatGPT can hardly tell what is a good or bad answer, also, a lot of posts are old (between 2015-2020), which means some of the good answers can be irrelevant now because the methods are deprecated or changed.

A good example that shows that ChatGPT gives bad answer is [this simple question](https://chatgpt.com/share/6735c149-4e30-8000-8b07-8c836247955a).
Also, for people that read a lot of forums posts on any engine can confirm that maybe 30 to 50% of answers are not correct or ideal. This helps you imagine how wrong any AI trained on that data can be correct.

# Conclusion
Try to not use ChatGPT or any other GPT AI, some can be less worse than ChatGPT like Perplexity because it gives you the used sources.

**Learn by yourself!** There is no better way to learn and improve, it's okay to be slow, or to not do the correct thing the first times.
It is very important to learn doing research's on the internet (or elsewhere) by yourself to find answers, this makes you better at finding how to express your thoughts, find keywords and improve your criticism.
And there is a ton of friendly humans that can answer your question with more knowledge and correctness that GPT models could ever have, find them in the correct forums or communities (shout-out to the [Unreal Source Discord](https://discord.gg/unrealsource) and [Unity Official Discord](https://discord.gg/unity)).
