# Quality of life:
- Cannot open multiple prefab tabs
- Cannot open multiple project view

# Viewport
- Incremental Snapping scale is unusable because its scaling relatively to the current object scale and not from the fixed original size (See https://discussions.unity.com/t/incremental-grid-snapping-completely-unusable/893964)

# Lightning
- Loading scene in additive ruins all lightning and fog effects (tested on HDRP 2022-23)

# Scenes
- You can nest scenes but only by 1 depth, and only one instance per scene
