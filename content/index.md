title: hzFishy's game Dev Notes
---
# Welcome
In those "notes" you will find my notes related to UE and other game dev and design stuff.
This is where I store stuff so I can find them later if I ever forget.

Most of the pages are just my personal storage place. But other pages like [[Unreal Engine learning speedrun]] were written for other people.


My main language isn't English, I apologies for any incorrect formulated sentences. I do my best to check the spelling and grammar.

# Contact
If you want to contact me for any reason (misspelling, feedback or ideas to improve some specific page(s)), you can @ me (`@hzfishy`) on the [Unreal Source Discord Server](https://discord.gg/unrealsource). If you send me a friend request I will probably deny it (because of spams).
